     * Invoice Items represent the component lines of an [invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices). An invoice item is added to an
     * invoice by creating or updating it with an `invoice` field, at which point it will be included as
     * [an invoice line item](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/line_item) within
     * [invoice.lines](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines).
     *
     * Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined
     * with a [subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions). Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge
     * or credit the customer's card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges
     * (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.
     *
     * Related guides: [Integrate with the Invoicing API](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration), [Subscription Invoices](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-upcoming-invoice-items).

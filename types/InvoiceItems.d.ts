     *
     * Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined

     * or credit the customer's card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges
     * (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.

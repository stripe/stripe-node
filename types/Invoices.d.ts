     * Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
     * generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.
     *
     * They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
     * that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).
     *
     * If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
     * Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
     * that finalizing the invoice,
     * [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/workflow/#auto_advance), does
     * not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
     * until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
     * webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
     * connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
     * creation to finalize the invoice.
     *
     * If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
     * [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
     * Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
     * emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
     *
     * Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
     * amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
     * charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
     * per currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
     * invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
     * customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.
     *
     * More details on the customer's credit balance are
     * [here](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance).

       * status (or requires_capture, if capture_method is set to manual).

       * confirmation is required to complete the payment.
       *
       * If the confirmation_method is manual, all payment attempts must be
       * initiated using a secret key.

       * return to the requires_confirmation state

       * attempt. Read the [expanded documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents/web-manual)

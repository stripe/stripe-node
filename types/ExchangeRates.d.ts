     * [Deprecated] The `ExchangeRate` APIs are deprecated. Please use the [FX Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/currencies/localize-prices/fx-quotes-api) instead.
     *
     * `ExchangeRate` objects allow you to determine the rates that Stripe is currently
     * using to convert from one currency to another. Since this number is variable
     * throughout the day, there are various reasons why you might want to know the current
     * rate (for example, to dynamically price an item for a user with a default
     * payment in a foreign currency).
     *
     * Please refer to our [Exchange Rates API](https://stripe.com/docs/fx-rates) guide for more details.
     *
     * *[Note: this integration path is supported but no longer recommended]* Additionally,
     * you can guarantee that a charge is made with an exchange rate that you expect is
     * current. To do so, you must pass in the exchange_rate to charges endpoints. If the
     * value is no longer up to date, the charge won't go through. Please refer to our
     * [Using with charges](https://stripe.com/docs/exchange-rates) guide for more details.

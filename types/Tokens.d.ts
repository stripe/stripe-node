     * Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank
     * account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from
     * your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is
     * returned to your server to use. Use our
     * [recommended payments integrations](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) to perform this process
     * on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server,
     * and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.
     *
     * If you can't use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using
     * the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If
     * your integration uses this method, you're responsible for any PCI compliance
     * that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with
     * client-side tokenization, your customer's information isn't sent directly to
     * Stripe, so we can't determine how it's handled or stored.
     *
     * You can't store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account
     * information for later use, create [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)
     * objects or [External accounts](https://stripe.com/api#external_accounts).
     * [Radar](https://stripe.com/docs/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection,
     * performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.

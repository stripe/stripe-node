# Stripe Node.js Library

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/stripe.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/stripe)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/stripe.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stripe)
[![Try on RunKit](https://badge.runkitcdn.com/stripe.svg)](https://runkit.com/npm/stripe)

The Stripe Node library provides convenient access to the Stripe API from
applications written in server-side JavaScript.

For collecting customer and payment information in the browser, use [Stripe.js][stripe-js].

## Documentation

See the [`stripe-node` API docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api?lang=node) for Node.js.

## Requirements

Per our [Language Version Support Policy](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/versioning?lang=node#stripe-sdk-language-version-support-policy), we currently support all LTS versions of **Node.js 16+**.

Support for Node 16 is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming major version. Read more and see the full schedule in the docs: https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/versioning?lang=node#stripe-sdk-language-version-support-policy

## Installation

Install the package with:

```sh
npm install stripe
# or
yarn add stripe
```

## Usage

The package needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is
available in the [Stripe Dashboard][api-keys]. Require it with the key's
value:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_test_...');

stripe.customers.create({
  email: 'customer@example.com',
})
  .then(customer => console.log(customer.id))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

Or using ES modules and `async`/`await`:

```js
import Stripe from 'stripe';
const stripe = new Stripe('sk_test_...');

const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
  email: 'customer@example.com',
});

console.log(customer.id);
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you're using `v17.x.x` or later and getting an error about a missing API key despite being sure it's available, it's likely you're importing the file that instantiates `Stripe` while the key isn't present (for instance, during a build step).
> If that's the case, consider instantiating the client lazily:
>
> ```ts
> import Stripe from 'stripe';
>
> let _stripe: Stripe | null = null;
> const getStripe = (): Stripe => {
>   if (!_stripe) {
>     _stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY as string, {
>       // ...
>     });
>   }
>   return _stripe;
> };
>
> const getCustomers = () => getStripe().customers.list();
> ```
>
> Alternatively, you can provide a placeholder for the real key (which will be enough to get the code through a build step):
>
> ```ts
> import Stripe from 'stripe';
>
> export const stripe = new Stripe(
>   process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY || 'api_key_placeholder',
>   {
>     // ...
>   }
> );
> ```

### Usage with TypeScript

As of 8.0.1, Stripe maintains types for the latest [API version][api-versions].

Import Stripe as a default import (not `* as Stripe`, unlike the DefinitelyTyped version)
and instantiate it as `new Stripe()` with the latest API version.

```ts
import Stripe from 'stripe';
const stripe = new Stripe('sk_test_...');

const createCustomer = async () => {
  const params: Stripe.CustomerCreateParams = {
    description: 'test customer',
  };

  const customer: Stripe.Customer = await stripe.customers.create(params);

  console.log(customer.id);
};
createCustomer();
```

You can find a full TS server example in [stripe-samples](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment/tree/main/custom-payment-flow/server/node-typescript).

#### Using old API versions with TypeScript

Types can change between API versions (e.g., Stripe may have changed a field from a string to a hash),
so our types only reflect the latest API version.

We therefore encourage [upgrading your API version][api-version-upgrading]
if you would like to take advantage of Stripe's TypeScript definitions.

If you are on an older API version (e.g., `2019-10-17`) and not able to upgrade,
you may pass another version and use a comment like `// @ts-ignore stripe-version-2019-10-17` to silence type errors here
and anywhere the types differ between your API version and the latest.
When you upgrade, you should remove these comments.

We also recommend using `// @ts-ignore` if you have access to a beta feature and need to send parameters beyond the type definitions.

#### Using `expand` with TypeScript

[Expandable][expanding_objects] fields are typed as `string | Foo`,
so you must cast them appropriately, e.g.,

```ts
const paymentIntent: Stripe.PaymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.retrieve(
  'pi_123456789',
  {
    expand: ['customer'],
  }
);
const customerEmail: string = (paymentIntent.customer as Stripe.Customer).email;
```

#### TypeScript and the stripe-node versioning policy

The TypeScript types in stripe-node always reflect the latest shape of the Stripe API. When the Stripe API changes in a [backwards-incompatible way](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#what-changes-does-stripe-consider-to-be-backwards-compatible), there is a new Stripe API version, and we release a new major version of stripe-node. Sometimes, though, the Stripe API changes in a way that weakens the guarantees provided by the TypeScript types, but that cannot result in any backwards incompatibility at runtime. For example, we might add a new enum value on a response, along with a new parameter to a request. Adding a new value to a response enum weakens the TypeScript type. However, if the new enum value is only returned when the new parameter is provided, this cannot break any existing usages and so would not be considered a breaking API change. In stripe-node, we do NOT consider such changes to be breaking under our current versioning policy. This means that you might see new type errors from TypeScript as you upgrade minor versions of stripe-node, that you can resolve by adding additional type guards.

Please feel welcome to share your thoughts about the versioning policy in a Github issue. For now, we judge it to be better than the two alternatives: outdated, inaccurate types, or vastly more frequent major releases, which would distract from any future breaking changes with potentially more disruptive runtime implications.

### Using Promises

Every method returns a chainable promise which can be used instead of a regular
callback:

```js
// Create a new customer and then create an invoice item then invoice it:
stripe.customers
  .create({
    email: 'customer@example.com',
  })
  .then((customer) => {
    // have access to the customer object
    return stripe.invoiceItems
      .create({
        customer: customer.id, // set the customer id
        amount: 2500, // 25
        currency: 'usd',
        description: 'One-time setup fee',
      })
      .then((invoiceItem) => {
        return stripe.invoices.create({
          collection_method: 'send_invoice',
          customer: invoiceItem.customer,
        });
      })
      .then((invoice) => {
        // New invoice created on a new customer
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        // Deal with an error
      });
  });
```

### Usage with Deno

As of 11.16.0, stripe-node provides a `deno` export target. In your Deno project, import stripe-node using an npm specifier:

Import using npm specifiers:

```js
import Stripe from 'npm:stripe';
```

Please see https://github.com/stripe-samples/stripe-node-deno-samples for more detailed examples and instructions on how to use stripe-node in Deno.

## Configuration

### Initialize with config object

The package can be initialized with several options:

```js
import ProxyAgent from 'https-proxy-agent';

const stripe = Stripe('sk_test_...', {
  maxNetworkRetries: 1,
  httpAgent: new ProxyAgent(process.env.http_proxy),
  timeout: 1000,
  host: 'api.example.com',
  port: 123,
  telemetry: true,
});
```

> **Note**
> Both `maxNetworkRetries` and `timeout` can be overridden on a per-request basis.

### Configuring Timeout

Timeout can be set globally via the config object:

```js
const stripe = Stripe('sk_test_...', {
  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds
});
```

And overridden on a per-request basis:

```js
stripe.customers.create(
  {
    email: 'customer@example.com',
  },
  {
    timeout: 1000, // 1 second
  }
);
```

### Configuring For Connect

A per-request `Stripe-Account` header for use with [Stripe Connect][connect]
can be added to any method:

```js
// List the balance transactions for a connected account:
stripe.balanceTransactions.list(
  {
    limit: 10,
  },
  {
    stripeAccount: 'acct_foo',
  }
);
```

### Configuring a Proxy

To use stripe behind a proxy you can pass an [https-proxy-agent][https-proxy-agent] on initialization:

```js
if (process.env.http_proxy) {
  const ProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

  const stripe = Stripe('sk_test_...', {
    httpAgent: new ProxyAgent(process.env.http_proxy),
  });
}
```

### Network retries

As of [v13](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/releases/tag/v13.0.0) stripe-node will automatically do one reattempt for failed requests that are safe to retry. Automatic network retries can be disabled by setting the `maxNetworkRetries` config option to `0`. You can also set a higher number to reattempt multiple times, with exponential backoff. [Idempotency keys](https://stripe.com/docs/api/idempotent_requests) are added where appropriate to prevent duplication.

```js
const stripe = Stripe('sk_test_...', {
  maxNetworkRetries: 0, // Disable retries
});
```

```js
const stripe = Stripe('sk_test_...', {
  maxNetworkRetries: 2, // Retry a request twice before giving up
});
```

Network retries can also be set on a per-request basis:

```js
stripe.customers.create(
  {
    email: 'customer@example.com',
  },
  {
    maxNetworkRetries: 2, // Retry this specific request twice before giving up
  }
);
```

### Examining Responses

Some information about the response which generated a resource is available
with the `lastResponse` property:

```js
customer.lastResponse.requestId; // see: https://stripe.com/docs/api/request_ids?lang=node
customer.lastResponse.statusCode;
```

### `request` and `response` events

The Stripe object emits `request` and `response` events. You can use them like this:

```js
const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_test_...');

const onRequest = (request) => {
  // Do something.
};

// Add the event handler function:
stripe.on('request', onRequest);

// Remove the event handler function:
stripe.off('request', onRequest);
```

#### `request` object

```js
{
  api_version: 'latest',
  account: 'acct_TEST',              // Only present if provided
  idempotency_key: 'abc123',         // Only present if provided
  method: 'POST',
  path: '/v1/customers',
  request_start_time: 1565125303932  // Unix timestamp in milliseconds
}
```

#### `response` object

```js
{
  api_version: 'latest',
  account: 'acct_TEST',              // Only present if provided
  idempotency_key: 'abc123',         // Only present if provided
  method: 'POST',
  path: '/v1/customers',
  status: 402,
  request_id: 'req_Ghc9r26ts73DRf',
  elapsed: 445,                      // Elapsed time in milliseconds
  request_start_time: 1565125303932, // Unix timestamp in milliseconds
  request_end_time: 1565125304377    // Unix timestamp in milliseconds
}
```

### Webhook signing

Stripe can optionally sign the webhook events it sends to your endpoint, allowing you to validate that they were not sent by a third-party. You can read more about it [here](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/signatures).

Please note that you must pass the _raw_ request body, exactly as received from Stripe, to the `constructEvent()` function; this will not work with a parsed (i.e., JSON) request body.

You can find an example of how to use this with various JavaScript frameworks in [`examples/webhook-signing`](examples/webhook-signing) folder, but here's what it looks like:

```js
const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
  webhookRawBody,
  webhookStripeSignatureHeader,
  webhookSecret
);
```

#### Testing Webhook signing

You can use `stripe.webhooks.generateTestHeaderString` to mock webhook events that come from Stripe:

```js
const payload = {
  id: 'evt_test_webhook',
  object: 'event',
};

const payloadString = JSON.stringify(payload, null, 2);
const secret = 'whsec_test_secret';

const header = stripe.webhooks.generateTestHeaderString({
  payload: payloadString,
  secret,
});

const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(payloadString, header, secret);

// Do something with mocked signed event
expect(event.id).to.equal(payload.id);
```
### How to use undocumented parameters and properties

In some cases, you might encounter parameters on an API request or fields on an API response that aren’t available in the SDKs.
This might happen when they’re undocumented or when they’re in preview and you aren’t using a preview SDK. 
See [undocumented params and properties](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/server-side?lang=node#undocumented-params-and-fields) to send those parameters or access those fields.

### Writing a Plugin

If you're writing a plugin that uses the library, we'd appreciate it if you instantiated your stripe client with `appInfo`, eg;

```js
const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_test_...', {
  appInfo: {
    name: 'MyAwesomePlugin',
    version: '1.2.34', // Optional
    url: 'https://myawesomeplugin.info', // Optional
  },
});
```

Or using ES modules or TypeScript:

```js
const stripe = new Stripe(apiKey, {
  appInfo: {
    name: 'MyAwesomePlugin',
    version: '1.2.34', // Optional
    url: 'https://myawesomeplugin.info', // Optional
  },
});
```

This information is passed along when the library makes calls to the Stripe API.

### Auto-pagination

We provide a few different APIs for this to aid with a variety of node versions and styles.

#### Async iterators (`for-await-of`)

If you are in a Node environment that has support for [async iteration](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration#the-async-iteration-statement-for-await-of),
such as Node 10+ or [babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-async-generator-functions),
the following will auto-paginate:

```js
for await (const customer of stripe.customers.list()) {
  doSomething(customer);
  if (shouldStop()) {
    break;
  }
}
```

#### `autoPagingEach`

If you are in a Node environment that has support for `await`, such as Node 7.9 and greater,
you may pass an async function to `.autoPagingEach`:

```js
await stripe.customers.list().autoPagingEach(async (customer) => {
  await doSomething(customer);
  if (shouldBreak()) {
    return false;
  }
});
console.log('Done iterating.');
```

Equivalently, without `await`, you may return a Promise, which can resolve to `false` to break:

```js
stripe.customers
  .list()
  .autoPagingEach((customer) => {
    return doSomething(customer).then(() => {
      if (shouldBreak()) {
        return false;
      }
    });
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Done iterating.');
  })
  .catch(handleError);
```

#### `autoPagingToArray`

This is a convenience for cases where you expect the number of items
to be relatively small; accordingly, you must pass a `limit` option
to prevent runaway list growth from consuming too much memory. Once the
`limit` number of items have been fetched, auto-pagination will stop.

Returns a promise of an array of all items across pages for a list request.

```js
const allNewCustomers = await stripe.customers
  .list({created: {gt: lastMonth}, limit: 100}) // 100 items per page
  .autoPagingToArray({limit: 10000}); // Stop after 10000 items total
```

### Telemetry

By default, the library sends request telemetry to Stripe regarding request
latency and feature usage. These
numbers help Stripe improve the overall latency of its API for all users, and
improve popular features.

You can disable this behavior if you prefer:

```js
const stripe = new Stripe('sk_test_...', {
  telemetry: false,
});
```

### Public Preview SDKs

Stripe has features in the [public preview phase](https://docs.stripe.com/release-phases) that can be accessed via versions of this package that have the `-beta.X` suffix like `18.6.0-beta.1`.
We would love for you to try these as we incrementally release new features and improve them based on your feedback.

The easiest way to install a public-preview release is to use the dedicated npm tag:

```
npm install stripe@public-preview --save-exact
```

Or, to install a specific version from the [releases page](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/releases/), you can specify that version explicitly:

```
npm install stripe@<some-version>
# for example:
# npm install stripe@18.6.0-beta.1
```

> **Note**
> There can be breaking changes between two versions of the public preview SDKs without a bump in the major version. Therefore we recommend pinning the package version to a specific version (i.e. using --save-exact) in your package.json file. This way you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally looking for the latest public preview SDK.

Some preview features require a name and version to be set in the `Stripe-Version` header like `feature_beta=v3`. If your preview feature has this requirement, use the `apiVersion` property of `config` object to set it:

```js
const stripe = new Stripe('sk_test_...', {
  apiVersion: '2022-08-01; feature_beta=v3',
});
```

### Private Preview SDKs

Stripe has features in the [private preview phase](https://docs.stripe.com/release-phases) that can be accessed via versions of this package that have the `-alpha.X` suffix like `18.6.0-alpha.1`. These are invite-only features. Once invited, you can install the private preview SDKs by following the same instructions as for the [public preview SDKs](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node?tab=readme-ov-file#public-preview-sdks) above and replacing the term `public-preview` with `private-preview`:

```
npm install stripe@private-preview --save-exact
```

### Custom requests

> This feature is only available from version 17 of this SDK.

If you would like to send a request to an undocumented API (for example you are in a private beta), or if you prefer to bypass the method definitions in the library and specify your request details directly, you can use the `rawRequest` method on the StripeClient object.

```javascript
const client = new Stripe('sk_test_...');

client.rawRequest(
    'POST',
    '/v1/beta_endpoint',
    { param: 123 },
    { apiVersion: '2022-11-15; feature_beta=v3' }
  )
  .then((response) => /* handle response */ )
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

Or using ES modules and `async`/`await`:

```javascript
import Stripe from 'stripe';
const stripe = new Stripe('sk_test_...');

const response = await stripe.rawRequest(
  'POST',
  '/v1/beta_endpoint',
  {param: 123},
  {apiVersion: '2022-11-15; feature_beta=v3'}
);

// handle response
```

## Support

New features and bug fixes are released on the latest major version of the `stripe` package. If you are on an older major version, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest in order to use the new features and bug fixes including those for security vulnerabilities. Older major versions of the package will continue to be available for use, but will not be receiving any updates.

run it from a background terminal ([stripe-mock's README][stripe-mock-usage]
also contains instructions for installing via Homebrew and other methods):

```bash
go get -u github.com/stripe/stripe-mock
stripe-mock
```

We use [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for conveniently running development tasks. You can use them directly, or copy the commands out of the `justfile`. To our help docs, run `just`.

Run all tests (installing the dependencies first, if needed)

```bash
just test
# or: yarn && yarn test
```

If you do not have `yarn` installed, consult its [installation instructions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

Run a single test suite:

```bash
just test test/Error.spec.ts
# or: yarn test test/Error.spec.ts
```

Run a single test (case sensitive) in watch mode:

```bash
just test test/Error.spec.ts --grep 'StripeError' --watch
# or: yarn test test/Error.spec.ts --grep 'StripeError' --watch
```

If you wish, you may run tests using your Stripe _Test_ API key by setting the
environment variable `STRIPE_TEST_API_KEY` before running the tests:

```bash
export STRIPE_TEST_API_KEY='sk_test....'
just test
# or: yarn test
```

Run prettier:

Add an [editor integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) or:

```bash
just format
# or: yarn prettier src/**/*.ts --write
```
